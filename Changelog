Version 2.1.1 (Nov 10, 2017)
	* Use '~' operator instead of '-' for negation, for compatibility
	  with recent version of numpy.

Version 2.1.0 (Jun 17, 2017)
	* Command-line option to control netCDF version for output files.
	* Option to ignore etiket when grouping records together.
	* Option to switch to rpnpy backend (using new fstd2nc package).
	* Command-line option to read netCDF attributes from a file.

Version 2.0.0 (Mar 13, 2017)
	* Removed old "rpn" module, which has been superceded by the "fstd"
	  module.
	* Removed --old-output-style option for fstd2nc.
	* Added --time-units option for fstd2nc.
	* Some support for masked data.
	* Some support for 'X' and 'Y' grids.
	* Use simpler hash algorithm for generating ipX/igX keys.

Version 1.1.8 (Nov 8, 2016)
	* Some compatibility fixes for GEM 4.8 files:
	  - Less stringent matching for !! records.
	  - Allow any vgrid "version" for kind=5.
	  - Don't group records with different level "kind" values.

Version 1.1.7 (Oct 4, 2016)
	* In fstd2nc, when selecting particular variables to convert to netCDF,
	  make sure any associated 2D lat/lon fields are included.

Version 1.1.6 (Jul 11, 2016)
	* Allow writing to existing file (appending records).

Version 1.1.5 (Oct 7, 2015)
	* When writing a generic z-axis to FSTD format, may need to force the
	  casting to floating-point.
	* Work around an issue with gdll, where longitude at 360 is wrapped to
	  0.

Version 1.1.4 (Mar 23, 2015)
	* Allow raw binary data to be read from FSTD files (with a warning).
	* Fix bug when there are multiple erased/overwritten records.

Version 1.1.3 (Feb 20, 2015)
	* Add appropriate plotatts for LogHybrid axis.
	* Fix bug with get_latlon running out of available grid ids.

Version 1.1.2 (Feb 9, 2015)
	* Allow character data to be read from FSTD files.

Version 1.1.1 (Jan 16, 2015)
	* Workaround a bug in recent versions of numpy (>=1.7) that causes a
	  crash when trying to select a subset of columns from a record array.
	* Workaround for FSTD files that have less records than they should.
	  Print a warning message and continue with whatever records are found.

Version 1.1.0 (Nov 6, 2014)
	* Add an option to fstd2nc to force it to use the same output style as
	  the old rpn2nc utility.
	* Add a --vars option to fstd2nc, to allow the user to select a subset
	  of variables to convert.
	* Put the command-line invocation of fstd2nc into the output file
	  metadata.
	* Add better error trapping when trying to write to an FSTD file.

Version 1.0.0 (Sep 9, 2014)
	* Add a new 'prepare_records' method, to convert Var objects to FSTD
	  records.  The result is left as a numpy (record) array, to allow the
	  use to tweak the raw values before writing to a file.
	* When writing back to a file, use the variable's own datyp / nbits
	  attributes for the encoding (if they're defined).
	* When writing to an FSTD file, do appropriate type casting where
	  necessary, and choose a type appropriate to the provided numpy array.

Version 0.9.2 (Jun 11, 2014)
	* Fix some bugs related to writing FSTD files (preserve 'deet' value,
	  fix bug in lat/lon record data_funcs, fix 'skip' value in loghybrid
	  table).

Version 0.9.1 (May 8, 2014)
	* Fix bug in Hybrid axis 'A' parameter.  The pref in the formula
	  is supposed to be in units of Pa, but was in units of hPa.

Version 0.9.0 (Apr 16, 2014)
	* Allow warning messages to be turned off when opening fstd files.
	* New converter script fstd2nc.
	* Allow fstd.open() to return a raw list of variables, instead of
	  processing them into a Dataset (eliminates some axis name munging).

Version 0.8.4 (Oct 22, 2013)
	* Force garbage collection when FSTD unit numbers are being exhausted.
	  The old units could be lingering in numpy arrays, which may not get
	  garbage collected right away.  This may be a source of a stubborn
	  segmentation fault.

Version 0.8.3 (Sep 6, 2013)

	* Disable information messages from the FSTD interface. This was producing
	  a *lot* of messages, drowning out any other information being printed to the
	  screen.

Version 0.8.2 (Aug 21, 2013)
	* Fix bug in FSTD_Var.__init__, where the levels were being ordered
	  incorrectly.

Version 0.8.1 (Aug 16, 2013)
	* Fix some bugs in the packaging mechanism:
	  - pygeode.formats.fstd was not properly packaged.
	  - Extra .so files were being erroneously included in the package.
	  - numpy.distutils breaks down in debuild.  Revert to builtin
	    distutils, and the Fortran compilation in a separate step in the
	    Makefile.

Version 0.8.0 (Aug 14, 2013)
	* Implement a new version of the interface (fstd) that uses the rmnlib
	  routines for the low-level I/O.  Requires rmnlib to run properly.

Version 0.7.2 (Aug 9, 2013)
	* Bug fix - pass metadata through Var.__init__() instead of
	  (accidentally) writing into the static class metadata.

Version 0.7.1 (Jun 6, 2013)
	* Bug fix - coordinate variables should be distinguished by ip1,ip2,ip3
	  values (in addition to usual unique attributes).

Version 0.7.0 (May 28, 2013)
	* Add rudimentary support for '!!' vertical record.  No vertical
	  information is extracted beyond the 'zeta' values, though.
	* Fix the z-axis order.  Depending on the order of output for the
	  GEM model, the default order of records may not be adequate.

Version 0.6.1 (Feb 11, 2013)
	* Fixed bug in attaching latitude/longitude fields.  LAM/rotated grids
	  did not have coordinate information, due to a kludging of the ip2
	  value when using squash_forecasts flag.

Version 0.6.0 (Feb 6, 2013)
	* Push the --squash-forecast option deeper into the code, to avoid
	  triggering time/forecast assertions that are no longer applicable.
	* Factor out the code for decoding the time axis.
	* Don't use the IP2 value from the file.  Instead, regenerate a
	  "proper" IP2 from DEET/NPAS.

Version 0.5.0 (Jan 11, 2013)
	* Some support for reading compressed fields (datyp=133).
	* Option in rpn2nc to squash the forecast axis into the time axis.

Version 0.4.2 (Jan 7, 2013):
	* Minor bug fix in "p2ll" function - return statement was missing.

Version 0.4.1 (Jan 7, 2013):
	* Minor bug fix in geophy.

Version 0.4.0 (Jan 7, 2013):
	* Add support for GEM geophy binary files.
	* Adjust date to be date of analysis, not date of validity.
	* Support for multiple forecast hours in the same file.
	* Allow for negative forecast hours.

Version 0.3.1 (July 20, 2012):
	* Fix bug with RPN date stamps.  Need to use floating-point during the
	  conversion, or we can't resolve time intervals less than an hour.

Version 0.3.0 (July 3, 2012):
	* Some minor code cleanup.
	* Interface for raw 'BMF' files used by the GEM model.

Version 0.2.0 (May 14, 2012):
	* Low-level file I/O routines updated / validated against the actual
	  RPN file interface.
	* Fixed bug in decoding R32 fields (packed 32-bit).
	* Some support for rotated (E) grids.
	* A new script to convert from RPN files to netCDF (rpn2nc).

Version 0.1.0 (May 9, 2012):
	* Initial version.
	* Works on global uniform (unrotated) grid files.
	* Some support for polar stereographic grids.
